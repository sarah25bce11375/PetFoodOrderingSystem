**Project Title**: Pet Food Ordering System

**Overview**
- **Description**: A lightweight Python-based collection of scripts to analyze and visualize aspects of a pet food ordering system. The repository contains tools for analyzing order data and generating graphs and ratings used for internal reports or dashboarding.
- **Purpose**: Make it easy to run local analyses, generate visual outputs, and inspect shop ratings and order trends for the Pet Food Ordering System project.

**Features**
- **Data analysis scripts**: Tools such as `analyzer.py` perform data processing tasks.
- **Graphing utilities**: Scripts like `linegraphmenudetail.py` and `shattergraph.py` generate plots for visual analysis.
- **Shop rating inspection**: `shoprating.py` provides utilities to compute or display shop ratings.
- **Lightweight and script-driven**: Designed to be run from the command line for quick checks and local development.

**Technologies / Tools Used**
- **Language**: Python (3.8+ recommended)
- **Libraries**: Uses standard Python libraries; add third-party packages if your analysis scripts require them (e.g., `pandas`, `matplotlib`).
- **Runtime**: Windows PowerShell (examples shown for PowerShell)

**Install & Run**
- **Prerequisites**: Install Python 3.8 or newer. Verify by running `python --version`.
- **Recommended (create a virtual environment)**:

```powershell
# create a virtual environment (Windows PowerShell)
python -m venv .venv
; .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
# upgrade pip
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

- **Install optional dependencies** (if your scripts need them). Example using `pandas` and `matplotlib`:

```powershell
python -m pip install pandas matplotlib
```

- **Run a script** (examples):

```powershell
# Run the main analyzer
python analyzer.py

# Generate a line graph detail (if the script accepts input arguments, pass them accordingly)
python linegraphmenudetail.py

# Generate a shatter graph
python shattergraph.py

# Inspect shop rating utilities
python shoprating.py
```

Notes:
- Some scripts may require input data files or command-line arguments. Check the top of each Python file for usage examples or comments.

**Testing / Validation Instructions**
- **Unit tests**: This repository does not include an automated test suite by default. To add tests, create a `tests/` folder and use `pytest`.

```powershell
# install pytest (optional)
python -m pip install pytest
# run tests
pytest
```

- **Manual testing**:
- Run each script and verify they complete without errors and produce the expected outputs (console messages, generated plot files, or image files). Example checks:
	- `analyzer.py` should run without raising exceptions and (if applicable) print a summary or write an output file.
	- `linegraphmenudetail.py` and `shattergraph.py` should produce image files (`.png`, `.svg`) or display graphs.
	- `shoprating.py` should output rating summaries or write a report file.

- **Logging and debug**: If a script fails, run it with increased verbosity or add `print()` / logging statements near the error site. Confirm required data files exist and are in the expected format.

**Contributing**
- Feel free to add unit tests, document script arguments, or add a `requirements.txt` file listing needed packages.

**Contact / Notes**
- This README is intentionally concise. For detailed usage, open the script files (`analyzer.py`, `linegraphmenudetail.py`, `shattergraph.py`, `shoprating.py`) and follow any usage comments at the top of each file.
